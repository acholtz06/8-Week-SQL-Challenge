#### 3. The Pizza Runner team now wants to add an additional ratings system that allows customers to rate their runner, how would you design an additional table for this new dataset - generate a schema for this new table and insert your own data for ratings for each successful customer order between 1 to 5.

    CREATE TABLE ratings AS
    SELECT DISTINCT (c.order_id),
    	c.customer_id,
        r.runner_id

    LEFT JOIN pizza_runner.customer_orders AS c
    	ON r.order_id = c.order_id
    WHERE r.cancellation IS NULL;

    ALTER TABLE ratings
    ADD rating INTEGER;

    UPDATE ratings
    SET rating = 4 
    WHERE order_id = 1;

    UPDATE ratings
    SET rating = 5 
    WHERE order_id = 2;

    UPDATE ratings
    SET rating = 5 
    WHERE order_id = 3;

    UPDATE ratings
    SET rating = 3

    UPDATE ratings
    SET rating = 4
    WHERE order_id = 7;

    UPDATE ratings
    SET rating = 5 
    WHERE order_id = 8;

    UPDATE ratings
    SET rating = 5 
    WHERE order_id = 10;

    SELECT *
    FROM ratings;
