###### All data and case study questions were taken from Data With Danny and can be found [here](https://8weeksqlchallenge.com/case-study-2/)

## ‚úèÔ∏è Business Task

Danny has a pizza restaurant and he wants to expand his business by hiring runners to pick up pizzas from Pizza Runner Headquarters and deliver them right the the customer's home. He would like to take a look at how the runner system is working and see if it is worth expanding the program.

## üßÄ Data Cleaning
    UPDATE pizza_runner.customer_orders
    SET exclusions = NULL
    WHERE exclusions = 'null';

    UPDATE pizza_runner.customer_orders
    SET exclusions = NULL
    WHERE exclusions = '';

    UPDATE pizza_runner.customer_orders
    SET extras = NULL
    WHERE extras = 'null';

    UPDATE pizza_runner.customer_orders
    SET extras = NULL
    WHERE extras = '';

    UPDATE pizza_runner.runner_orders
    SET pickup_time = NULL
    WHERE pickup_time = 'null';

    ALTER TABLE pizza_runner.runner_orders
    ALTER COLUMN pickup_time TYPE TIMESTAMP
    USING pickup_time::TIMESTAMP;
    
    UPDATE pizza_runner.runner_orders
    SET distance = NULL
    WHERE distance = 'null';

    UPDATE pizza_runner.runner_orders
    SET duration = NULL
    WHERE duration = 'null';

    UPDATE pizza_runner.runner_orders
    SET cancellation = NULL
    WHERE cancellation = 'null';

    UPDATE pizza_runner.runner_orders
    SET cancellation = NULL
    WHERE cancellation = '';

    UPDATE pizza_runner.runner_orders
    SET distance = TRIM('km' FROM distance);

    ALTER TABLE pizza_runner.runner_orders
    RENAME COLUMN distance to distance_in_km;

    ALTER TABLE pizza_runner.runner_orders
    ALTER COLUMN distance_in_km TYPE NUMERIC
    USING distance_in_km::NUMERIC;

    UPDATE pizza_runner.runner_orders
    SET duration = TRIM('minutes' FROM duration);

    ALTER TABLE pizza_runner.runner_orders
    RENAME COLUMN duration to duration_in_mins;

    ALTER TABLE pizza_runner.runner_orders
    ALTER COLUMN duration_in_mins TYPE NUMERIC
    USING duration_in_mins::NUMERIC;

There were several items that needed cleaned within the provided data:
- There were columns in multiple tables that had null values as *null*, NULL, or '' - I updated all of these columns to reflect *null* uniformly
- The values distance and duration columns of the runner_order table both were not formatted the same way (ex. 15km vs 15 kilometers vs 15). To fix this, I trimmed the columns of any version of abbreviations and then renamed the columns to reflect the units (distance_in_km and duration_in_mins)
- A few of the columns were not the correct data type (changed pickup_time to TIMESTAMP, distnace_in_km to NUMERIC, duration_in_mins to NUMERIC)

## ü´ë Case Study Questions

### üçï A. Pizza Metrics
#### 1. How many pizzas were ordered?

    SELECT COUNT(pizza_id) AS num_pizzas_ordered
    FROM pizza_runner.customer_orders;

| num_pizzas_ordered |
| ------------------ |
| 14                 |

Steps:
- Counted the number of pizza ids

Insights:
- There were 14 pizzas ordered through the runner program

---
#### 2. How many unique customer orders were made?

    SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT order_id) AS num_orders
    FROM pizza_runner.customer_orders;

| num_orders |
| ---------- |
| 10         |

Steps:
- Counted the distinct order ids

Insights:
- There were 10 total orders made through the runner program

---
#### 3. How many successful orders were delivered by each runner?

    SELECT runner_id,
    	COUNT(order_id) AS successful_deliveries
    FROM pizza_runner.runner_orders
    WHERE pickup_time IS NOT NULL
    GROUP BY runner_id
    ORDER BY runner_id;

| runner_id | successful_deliveries |
| --------- | --------------------- |
| 1         | 4                     |
| 2         | 3                     |
| 3         | 1                     |

Steps:
- Counted the order ids
- Grouped by the runner id to show the number of deliveries per runner
- Filtered for orderes that were not cancelled

Insights:
- There is no real pattern for how many orders runners are taking
- Runner 1 had the most successful deliveries
- Runner 3 had the least successful deliveries
---
#### 4. How many of each type of pizza was delivered?

    SELECT c.pizza_id,
    	COUNT(c.pizza_id) AS num_delivered
    FROM pizza_runner.customer_orders AS c
    JOIN pizza_runner.runner_orders AS r
    ON c.order_id = r.order_id
    WHERE r.pickup_time IS NOT NULL
    GROUP BY c.pizza_id
    ORDER BY c.pizza_id;

| pizza_id | num_delivered |
| -------- | ------------- |
| 1        | 9             |
| 2        | 3             |

Steps:
- Joined the customer_orders and the runner_orders tables in order to find which pizzas were ordered and if they were successfully delivered
- Counted the pizza ids
- Grouped by pizza_id to see how many of each pizza was delivered
- Filtered for pizzas that were not cancelled

Insights:
- Looking at the rest of the data shows that pizza_id 1 is Meatlovers and pizza_id 2 is Vegetarian
- pizza_id 1 (Meatlovers) is the more popular pizza
---
#### 5. How many Vegetarian and Meatlovers were ordered by each customer?

    SELECT c.customer_id,
    	n.pizza_name,
        COUNT(n.pizza_name) AS num_ordered
    FROM pizza_runner.customer_orders AS c
    JOIN pizza_runner.pizza_names AS n
    ON c.pizza_id = n.pizza_id
    GROUP BY c.customer_id,
    	n.pizza_name
    ORDER BY c.customer_id;

| customer_id | pizza_name | num_ordered |
| ----------- | ---------- | ----------- |
| 101         | Meatlovers | 2           |
| 101         | Vegetarian | 1           |
| 102         | Meatlovers | 2           |
| 102         | Vegetarian | 1           |
| 103         | Meatlovers | 3           |
| 103         | Vegetarian | 1           |
| 104         | Meatlovers | 3           |
| 105         | Vegetarian | 1           |

Steps:
- Joined the customer_orders and the pizza_names tables to see which pizzas were ordered and what their names are
- Counted the pizza names
- Grouped by the customer id and pizza name to see how many of each pizza was ordered for each customer

Insights:
- Most customers have tried both pizzas
- All but one customer prefers the Meatlovers pizza

---
#### 6. What was the maximum number of pizzas delivered in a single order?

    SELECT c.order_id,
    	COUNT(c.pizza_id) AS max_delivered
    FROM pizza_runner.customer_orders AS c
    JOIN pizza_runner.runner_orders AS r
    ON c.order_id = r.order_id
    WHERE r.pickup_time IS NOT NULL
    GROUP BY c.order_id
    ORDER BY max_delivered DESC
    LIMIT 1;

| order_id | max_delivered |
| -------- | ------------- |
| 4        | 3             |

Steps:
- Joined the customer_orders and the runner_orders tables to see the pizzas in each order and whether or not they were delivered successfully
- Counted the pizza ids
- Grouped by the order id to see how many pizzas were in each order
- Filtered for only successful deliveries
- Ordered by the count in descending so that the order with the most pizzas was at the top
- Limited the results to 1 to show the maximum number delivered

Insights:
- Orders through the pizza runner program all have 3 or fewer pizzas per order

---
#### 7. For each customer, how many delivered pizzas had at least 1 change and how many had no changes?

    WITH pizzas AS (
    	SELECT c.customer_id,
    		CASE WHEN exclusions IS NOT NULL OR extras IS NOT NULL
    			THEN 'Yes'
            	ELSE 'No'
            	END AS changes
    	FROM pizza_runner.customer_orders AS c
    	JOIN pizza_runner.runner_orders AS r
    	ON c. order_id = r.order_id
    	WHERE r.pickup_time IS NOT NULL)
    
    SELECT customer_id,
    	changes,
    	COUNT(changes) AS num_pizzas
    FROM pizzas
    GROUP BY customer_id, changes
    ORDER BY customer_id;

| customer_id | changes | num_pizzas |
| ----------- | ------- | ---------- |
| 101         | No      | 2          |
| 102         | No      | 3          |
| 103         | Yes     | 3          |
| 104         | Yes     | 2          |
| 104         | No      | 1          |
| 105         | Yes     | 1          |

Steps:
- Created a CTE called pizzas
- Joined the customer_orders and the runner_orders tables to see the changes that were made as well as successful deliveries
- Used a CASE statement to denote wheather a pizza had changes or not (any changes in the extras OR exclusions columns = 'Yes' and pizzas with no changes in either column = 'No')
- Filtered for successful deliveries
- Using the pizzas CTE, I counted the pizzas that had any changes
- Grouped by the customer id to see the changes made for each individual customer

Insights:
- 3 customers made changes while 3 did not
- Only customer 104 ordered pizzas with changes and without
- Half of the pizzas ordered had changes
  
---
#### 8. How many pizzas were delivered that had both exclusions and extras?

    WITH pizzas AS (
    	SELECT c.customer_id,
    		CASE WHEN exclusions IS NOT NULL AND extras IS NOT NULL
    			THEN 'Yes'
            	ELSE 'No'
            	END AS changes
    	FROM pizza_runner.customer_orders AS c
    	JOIN pizza_runner.runner_orders AS r
    	ON c. order_id = r.order_id
    	WHERE r.pickup_time IS NOT NULL)
    
    SELECT COUNT(changes) AS num_pizzas
    FROM pizzas
    WHERE changes = 'Yes';

| num_pizzas |
| ---------- |
| 1          |

Steps:
- I used the same CTE as the problem above, except I changed the CASE statement to say AND instead of OR so that both the extras and the exclusions columns had to have changes
- Using the pizzas CTE, I counted the number of pizzas in the changes column
- Filtered for only pizzas where changes = 'Yes' (had both exlusions and extras)

Insights:
- Only 1 pizza was ordered that had both exlusions and extras

---
#### 9. What was the total volume of pizzas ordered for each hour of the day?

    SELECT EXTRACT(hour FROM order_time) AS hour,
    	COUNT(order_id) AS vol_pizzas
    FROM pizza_runner.customer_orders
    GROUP BY hour
    ORDER BY hour;

| hour | vol_pizzas |
| ---- | ---------- |
| 11   | 1          |
| 13   | 3          |
| 18   | 3          |
| 19   | 1          |
| 21   | 3          |
| 23   | 3          |

---
#### 10. What was the volume of orders for each day of the week?

    WITH dow AS (
      SELECT order_id,
      	EXTRACT(dow FROM order_time) AS num_day
      FROM pizza_runner.customer_orders)
    
    SELECT num_day,
    	CASE WHEN num_day = 0
    		THEN 'Sunday'
            WHEN num_day = 1
            THEN 'Monday'
            WHEN num_day = 2
            THEN 'Tuesday'
            WHEN num_day = 3
            THEN 'Wednesday'
            WHEN num_day = 4
            THEN 'Thursday'
            WHEN num_day = 5
            THEN 'Friday'
            Else 'Saturday' END AS day_of_week,
    	COUNT(order_id) AS num_pizzas
    FROM dow
    GROUP BY day_of_week, num_day
    ORDER BY num_day;

| num_day | day_of_week | num_pizzas |
| ------- | ----------- | ---------- |
| 3       | Wednesday   | 5          |
| 4       | Thursday    | 3          |
| 5       | Friday      | 1          |
| 6       | Saturday    | 5          |

Steps:
- Created a CTE called dow
- Used EXTRACT() to get the day of the week from the order time
- Used the dow CTE to create a CASE statement where I gave each dow number a name so that the table can be more easily interpreted by stakeholders
- Counted the orders
- Grouped by the day of week to see the number of pizzas ordered per day

Insights:
- Wednesdays and Saturdays are the busiest days for the pizza runner program
- Friday is the slowest day for the pizza runner program

    WHERE r.pickup_time IS NOT NULL;

| dollars |

#### 3. The Pizza Runner team now wants to add an additional ratings system that allows customers to rate their runner, how would you design an additional table for this new dataset - generate a schema for this new table and insert your own data for ratings for each successful customer order between 1 to 5.

    CREATE TABLE ratings AS
    SELECT DISTINCT (c.order_id),
    	c.customer_id,
        r.runner_id

    	ON r.order_id = c.order_id
    WHERE r.cancellation IS NULL;

    ALTER TABLE ratings
    ADD rating INTEGER;

    UPDATE ratings
    SET rating = 4 
    WHERE order_id = 1;

    UPDATE ratings
    SET rating = 5 
    WHERE order_id = 2;

    UPDATE ratings
    SET rating = 5 
    WHERE order_id = 3;

    UPDATE ratings
    SET rating = 3 
    WHERE order_id = 4;

    UPDATE ratings
    SET rating = 5

    UPDATE ratings
    SET rating = 4
    WHERE order_id = 7;

    UPDATE ratings
    SET rating = 5 
    WHERE order_id = 8;

    UPDATE ratings
    SET rating = 5 
    WHERE order_id = 10;

    SELECT *
    FROM ratings;

| order_id | customer_id | runner_id | rating |
| -------- | ----------- | --------- | ------ |
| 1        | 101         | 1         | 4      |

#### - time between order and pickup
#### - delivery duration
#### - average speed
#### - total number of pizzas

#### 5. If a Meat Lovers pizza was $12 and Vegetarian $10 fixed prices with no cost for extras and each runner is paid $0.30 per kilometre traveled - how much money does Pizza Runner have left over after these deliveries?

    WITH prices AS (
      SELECT c.order_id,
      	c.pizza_id,
      	CASE WHEN c.pizza_id = 1 THEN 12
      	ELSE 10 END AS price,
      	ROUND((distance_in_km * 0.30), 2) AS runner_pay
      FROM pizza_runner.customer_orders AS c
    	JOIN pizza_runner.runner_orders AS r
    	ON c.order_id = r.order_id)
        
    SELECT ROUND((SUM(price) - SUM(runner_pay)), 2) AS dollars_left
    FROM prices
    WHERE runner_pay IS NOT NULL;

| dollars_left |
| ------------ |
| 73.38        |
