### C. Before & After Analysis

This technique is usually used when we inspect an important event and want to inspect the impact before and after a certain point in time.  
  
Taking the week_date value of 2020-06-15 as the baseline week where the Data Mart sustainable packaging changes came into effect.  
  
We would include all week_date values for 2020-06-15 as the start of the period after the change and the previous week_date values would be before  
  
Using this analysis approach - answer the following questions:

#### 1. What is the total sales for the 4 weeks before and after 2020-06-15? What is the growth or reduction rate in actual values and percentage of sales?


    WITH before AS (
    	SELECT DISTINCT(week_date)
    	FROM clean_weekly_sales
    	WHERE week_date < '2020-06-15'
    	ORDER BY week_date DESC
    	LIMIT 4)
    
    , after AS (
      SELECT DISTINCT(week_date)
      FROM clean_weekly_sales
      WHERE week_date >= '2020-6-15'
      ORDER BY week_date
      LIMIT 4)
      
    , totals AS (
      SELECT 
    	SUM(CASE WHEN week_date IN (SELECT * FROM before)
        	THEN sales END) AS four_weeks_before,
        SUM(CASE WHEN week_date IN (SELECT * FROM after)
        	THEN sales END) AS four_weeks_after
      FROM clean_weekly_sales)
      
    SELECT ROUND((four_weeks_after::numeric - four_weeks_before::numeric) / four_weeks_before::numeric * 100, 2) AS reduction_rate
    FROM totals;

| reduction_rate |
| -------------- |
| -1.15          |

---

#### 2. What about the entire 12 weeks before and after?

    WITH before AS (
    	SELECT DISTINCT(week_date)
    	FROM clean_weekly_sales
    	WHERE week_date < '2020-06-15'
    	ORDER BY week_date DESC
    	LIMIT 12)
    
    , after AS (
      SELECT DISTINCT(week_date)
      FROM clean_weekly_sales
      WHERE week_date >= '2020-6-15'
      ORDER BY week_date
      LIMIT 12)
      
    , totals AS (
      SELECT 
    	SUM(CASE WHEN week_date IN (SELECT * FROM before)
        	THEN sales END) AS twelve_weeks_before,
        SUM(CASE WHEN week_date IN (SELECT * FROM after)
        	THEN sales END) AS twelve_weeks_after
      FROM clean_weekly_sales)
      
    SELECT ROUND((twelve_weeks_after::numeric - twelve_weeks_before::numeric) / twelve_weeks_before::numeric * 100, 2) AS reduction_rate
    FROM totals;

| reduction_rate |
| -------------- |
| -2.14          |

---

#### 3. How do the sale metrics for these 2 periods before and after compare with the previous years in 2018 and 2019?

    WITH week_num AS (
      SELECT DISTINCT(week_number)
      FROM clean_weekly_sales
      WHERE week_date = '2020-06-15')
      
    , before AS (
      SELECT DISTINCT week_date
      FROM clean_weekly_sales
      WHERE week_number BETWEEN (SELECT week_number FROM week_num) - 4 AND (SELECT week_number FROM week_num) - 1)
    
    , after AS (
      SELECT DISTINCT week_date
      FROM clean_weekly_sales
      WHERE week_number BETWEEN (SELECT week_number FROM week_num) AND (SELECT week_number FROM week_num) + 3)
        
    , totals AS (
      SELECT calendar_year,
      	SUM(CASE WHEN week_date IN (SELECT * FROM before)
      		THEN sales END) AS four_weeks_before,
      	SUM(CASE WHEN week_date IN (SELECT * FROM after)
      		THEN sales END) AS four_weeks_after
      FROM clean_weekly_sales
      GROUP BY calendar_year
      ORDER BY calendar_year)
    
    SELECT calendar_year,
    	four_weeks_before,
        four_weeks_after,
    	ROUND((four_weeks_after::numeric - four_weeks_before::numeric) / four_weeks_before::numeric * 100, 2) AS growth_rate
    FROM totals;

| calendar_year | four_weeks_before | four_weeks_after | growth_rate |
| ------------- | ----------------- | ---------------- | ----------- |
| 2018          | 2119669585        | 2115732898       | -0.19       |
| 2019          | 2249989796        | 2252326390       | 0.10        |
