## ✏️ Business Task

Danny has created a new subscription service that streams only food related content - like Netflix for cooking and food shows from around the world. He started the service in 2020 and has a few options for monthly and annual subscriptions.  

The data that is provided will help Danny to make data driven descisions about future investments or new features that can be added.

## ⚠️ Data Limitations

This has been the case study with the least limitations out of the ones that I have done so far. There are plenty of customers to analyze and the time period spans more than a year, which is great for spotting trends in the data.  

The one thing that I feel could have been included to provide more insight is a customer survey asking why they decided to upgrade or drop the service. Since this wasn't included in the beginning, we can look at trends in the data we have and further investigate by sending out surveys to see why these trends are happening.

## 🔪 Data

There are two tables provided:
- plans
- subscriptions

## 🥘 Case Study Questions

### 👩‍🍳 A. Customer Journey
Based off the 8 sample customers provided in the sample from the subscriptions table, write a brief description about each customer’s onboarding journey.

Try to keep it as short as possible - you may also want to run some sort of join to make your explanations a bit easier!

---

    SELECT s.customer_id,
    	p.plan_name,
        s.start_date
    FROM foodie_fi.subscriptions AS s
    JOIN foodie_fi.plans AS p
    ON s.plan_id = p.plan_id
    WHERE s.customer_id = 1;

Steps:
- Joined the subscriptions and the plans tables so that I could use the plan_name instead of the plan_id
- Selected the customer_id, plan_name, and start_date
- Filtered for one customer in the sample subscriptions table (provided on the Data With Danny page linked above)
- Changed the filter for each customer in the sample table

### 📺 B. Data Analysis Questions
#### 1. How many customers has Foodie-Fi ever had?

    SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id) AS total_customers
    FROM foodie_fi.subscriptions;

| total_customers |
| --------------- |
| 1000            |

Steps:
- Counted the distinct customer_ids from the subscriptions table

Insights:
- There have been 1000 total customers

---
#### 2. What is the monthly distribution of trial plan start_date values for our dataset - use the start of the month as the group by value

    SELECT DATE_TRUNC('month', start_date) AS month,
    	COUNT(plan_id) AS trial_plan
    FROM foodie_fi.subscriptions
    WHERE plan_id = 0
    GROUP BY DATE_TRUNC('month', start_date)
    ORDER BY month;

| month                    | trial_plan |
| ------------------------ | ---------- |
| 2020-01-01T00:00:00.000Z | 88         |
| 2020-02-01T00:00:00.000Z | 68         |
| 2020-03-01T00:00:00.000Z | 94         |
| 2020-04-01T00:00:00.000Z | 81         |

| 2020-11-01T00:00:00.000Z | 75         |
| 2020-12-01T00:00:00.000Z | 84         |

Steps:
- Used DATE_TRUNC for the start_dates to have all dates start on the first of the month
- Counted the plan_ids
- Filtered for only trial plans
- Grouped by the truncated dates
- Ordered by month

Insights:
- The second month had the lowest number of new trial members
- The third month had the highest number of new trial members
- The number of new trial members per month doesn't vary too much
- The only outliers that stand out are the second and third months

---
#### 3. What plan start_date values occur after the year 2020 for our dataset? Show the breakdown by count of events for each plan_name

    SELECT DATE_TRUNC('month', start_date) AS month,
    	SUM(CASE WHEN plan_id = 0 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS trial,
    	SUM(CASE WHEN plan_id = 1 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS basic_monthly,
        SUM(CASE WHEN plan_id = 2 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS pro_monthly,
        SUM(CASE WHEN plan_id = 3 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS pro_annual,
        SUM(CASE WHEN plan_id = 4 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS churn
    FROM foodie_fi.subscriptions
    WHERE EXTRACT(year FROM start_date) > '2020'
    GROUP BY DATE_TRUNC('month', start_date)
    ORDER BY month;

| month                    | trial | basic_monthly | pro_monthly | pro_annual | churn |
| ------------------------ | ----- | ------------- | ----------- | ---------- | ----- |
| 2021-01-01T00:00:00.000Z | 0     | 8             | 26          | 24         | 19    |
| 2021-02-01T00:00:00.000Z | 0     | 0             | 12          | 17         | 18    |
| 2021-03-01T00:00:00.000Z | 0     | 0             | 15          | 9          | 21    |
| 2021-04-01T00:00:00.000Z | 0     | 0             | 7           | 13         | 13    |

Steps:
- Used DATE_TRUNC for the start_dates to have all dates start on the first of the month
- Used CASE statements for each of the plans where the plan = 1 if it matched the plan I was counting, and 0 if it didin't
- Filtered for only dates after the year 2020
- Grouped by the truncated month

Insights:
- No new trial customers started after 2020
- After the 8 upgrades in January, no one else upgraded to the basic monthly plan
- Most pro monthly and pro annual upgrades happened in January
- The most churned accounts happened in March

#### 4. What is the customer count and percentage of customers who have churned rounded to 1 decimal place?


    WITH churn AS (
    	SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id) AS customers,
    		(
          	    SELECT COUNT(customer_id)
    		    FROM foodie_fi.subscriptions
    		    WHERE plan_id = 4
        	) AS num_churn
    	FROM foodie_fi.subscriptions)
    
    SELECT num_churn,
    	ROUND((num_churn::numeric / customers::numeric) * 100, 1) AS churn_percent
    FROM churn;

| num_churn | churn_percent |
| --------- | ------------- |
| 307       | 30.7          |

Steps:
- Created a CTE called churn
- Counted the distinct customer_ids to get the total number of customers
- Used a subquery to count the customer_ids that had a plan_id of 4 (or churn)
- Used the CTE to select the number of customers that churned
- Divided the number of churned customers by the total number of customers and cast both of those numbers as the numeric data type
- Multiplied by 100 to show the percentage
- Rounded that answer to 1 decimal place

Insighs:
- 307 out of 1000 customer accounts churned
- 30.7% of the total customers churned

---
#### 5. How many customers have churned straight after their initial free trial - what percentage is this rounded to the nearest whole number?

    WITH plans AS (
    	SELECT *
    	FROM foodie_fi.subscriptions
    	WHERE plan_id NOT IN (1, 2, 3)
    	ORDER by customer_id,
    		plan_id)
    
    , counts AS (
      SELECT customer_id,
      	COUNT(plan_id) AS num_plans
      FROM plans
      GROUP BY customer_id
      HAVING COUNT(plan_id) = 2
      ORDER BY customer_id)
      
    , dates AS (
      SELECT p.customer_id,
      	p.plan_id,
      	p.start_date
      FROM plans AS p
      JOIN counts AS c
      ON p.customer_id = c.customer_id)
      
    , lagged AS (
      SELECT customer_id,
      	plan_id,
      	start_date,
      	LAG(start_date + 7, 1) OVER(
          PARTITION BY customer_id
          ORDER BY plan_id) AS churn_date
      FROM dates)
    
    , num_churned AS (
      SELECT COUNT(customer_id) AS churned_after_trial
      FROM lagged
      WHERE start_date = churn_date)
    
    
    SELECT churned_after_trial,
    	ROUND((churned_after_trial::numeric / 1000) * 100, 0) AS percent_churn_after_trial
    FROM num_churned;

| churned_after_trial | percent_churn_after_trial |
| ------------------- | ------------------------- |
| 92                  | 9                         |

Steps:
- CTE #1
    - Filtered out any plans from the subscriptions table that weren't either trial or churn
- CTE #2
    - Selected the customer_id and counted the plan_ids
    - Grouped by the customer_id
    - Filtered for only customers that had a count of 2, meaning that they had both a trial plan and churn
- CTE #3
    - Joined the plans and counts CTEs on customer_id
    - Selected the customer_id, plan_id, and start_date
    - The results of this CTE showed each customer, their trial start date, and their churn date
- CTE #4
    - Selected everything from the previous CTE
    - Used the LAG function to create a new column that diplayed the dates in the previous column lagged by 1, and with 7 days added. What this did is showed when the free trial ended, and put that date in the same record as the actual churn date
    - Partitioned the lag by the customer_id so no dates overlapped and ordered by the plan_id to make sure that the trial plan + 7 was always lagged next to churn
- CTE #5
    - Here is where I could look at each record and see if the end date of the free trial matched the churn date. Any dates that matched meant that the customer churned immediately after their free trial
    - I counted the customer_ids
    - Filtered for only ids where the start_date = churn_date
- Final Query
    - Selected the number of customers who churned right after the trial
    - Cast the number of customers who churned after the trial as numeric and divided that number by 1000. I used 1000 becuase I know that to be the total number of customers based on previous queries
    - Multiplied that number by 100 to show the percentage
    - Rounded to the nearest whole number

Insights:
- 92 customers cancelled their subscriptions immediately after their free trial period
- That comes to 9% of total customers

---
#### 6. What is the number and percentage of customer plans after their initial free trial?

    WITH ranks AS (
      SELECT *,
      	RANK() OVER(
          PARTITION BY customer_id
          ORDER BY start_date) AS plan_rank
      FROM foodie_fi.subscriptions)
    
    SELECT p.plan_name,
    	COUNT(r.plan_id) AS num_in_plan,
        ROUND((COUNT(r.plan_id)::numeric / (
        	SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id)
        	FROM ranks)) * 100, 0) AS percent_in_plan
    FROM ranks AS r
    JOIN foodie_fi.plans AS p
    ON r.plan_id = p.plan_id
    WHERE r.plan_rank = 2
    GROUP BY p.plan_name,
    	r.plan_id
    ORDER BY r.plan_id;

| plan_name     | num_in_plan | percent_in_plan |
| ------------- | ----------- | --------------- |
| basic monthly | 546         | 55              |
| pro monthly   | 325         | 33              |
| pro annual    | 37          | 4               |
| churn         | 92          | 9               |

Steps:
- Created a CTE called ranks
- Used RANK to number the plans
- Partitioned by the customer_id so each customer started at rank 1
- Ordered by the start date so that the plans each customer had were listed in the order that they signed up for them
- Joined the CTE to the plans table to get the plan names
- Counted the plan_ids
- Took the count of the plan_id cast as the numeric data type and divided by the total number of customer_id. I then multiplied that number by 100 to get the percentage. Finally, I rounded the percentage to the whole number
- Filtered for plans with the rank of 2. I did this because every customer starts with the free trial, which would be rank 1 for every customer. By selecting the rank of 2, I was able to see which plan came immediately after the free trial.
- Grouped by the plan_name and the plan_id

Insights:
- Over half of customers go straight to the basic monthly plan after the free trial
- A third of customers upgrade to the pro monthly plan after the free trial
- More customers churn after the free trial than upgrade to the pro annual subscription

---
#### 7. What is the customer count and percentage breakdown of all 5 plan_name values at 2020-12-31?

    WITH date AS (
      SELECT customer_id,
      	MAX(start_date) AS current_plan
      FROM foodie_fi.subscriptions
      WHERE start_date <= '2020-12-31'
      GROUP BY customer_id
      ORDER BY customer_id)
    
    SELECT p.plan_name,
    	COUNT(s.plan_id) AS num_in_plan,
        ROUND((COUNT(s.plan_id)::numeric / (
          SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id)
          FROM date)) * 100, 0) AS percent_in_plan
    FROM date AS d
    JOIN foodie_fi.subscriptions AS s
    ON d.customer_id = s.customer_id AND d.current_plan = s.start_date
    JOIN foodie_fi.plans AS p
    ON s.plan_id = p.plan_id
    GROUP BY p.plan_name,
    	s.plan_id
    ORDER BY s.plan_id;

| plan_name     | num_in_plan | percent_in_plan |
| ------------- | ----------- | --------------- |
| trial         | 19          | 2               |
| basic monthly | 224         | 22              |
| pro monthly   | 326         | 33              |
| pro annual    | 195         | 20              |
| churn         | 236         | 24              |

Steps:
- Created a CTE called date to find which plan each customer was subscribed to at the end of 2020
- Found the MAX (or most current) start date
- Filtered for start dates that we on or before 2020-12-31
- Grouped by customer_id
- Joined the CTE to the subscriptions table. I made sure to use an inner join and join on the current_plan from the CTE = the start_date so that those were the only date included
- Joined the plans table to get the plan_names
- Counted the plan_ids to get the total number of customers in each plan
- Took the count of the customers in each plan cast as the numeric data type and divided that by the total number of customers. I multiplied that number by 100 to get the percentage and rounded to the whole number
- Grouped by the plan_name and plan_id

Insights:
- At the end of 2020, the most popular plan was the pro monthly, with 33% of members subscribed
- The least popular plan is the pro annual, with 20% of members subscribed
- 2% of customers were new and in their 1 week free trial at the end of 2020
  
---
#### 8. How many customers have upgraded to an annual plan in 2020?

    SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id) AS num_upgraded
    FROM foodie_fi.subscriptions
    WHERE plan_id = 3 AND start_date IN (
      SELECT start_date
      FROM foodie_fi.subscriptions
      WHERE start_date BETWEEN '2020-01-01' AND '2020-12-31');

| num_upgraded |
| ------------ |
| 195          |

Steps:
- Selected the count of distinct customer_ids
- Filtered for only plan_id = 3 (pro annual)
- I used a subquery in the WHERE clause to filter for start_dates in 2020
  
---
#### 9. How many days on average does it take for a customer to upgrade to an annual plan from the day they join Foodie-Fi?

    WITH join_date AS (
      SELECT *
      FROM foodie_fi.subscriptions
      WHERE plan_id = 0)
    
    , annual AS (
      SELECT *
      FROM foodie_fi.subscriptions
      WHERE plan_id = 3)
    
    SELECT ROUND(AVG(a.start_date - j.start_date), 0) AS avg_days_to_upgrade
    FROM join_date AS j
    JOIN annual AS a
    ON j.customer_id = a.customer_id;

| avg_days_to_upgrade |
| ------------------- |
| 105                 |

Steps:
- Created a CTE called join_date
- Took the subscriptions table and filtered for only trial plans because the trial start date is the day they joined Foodie Fi
- Created another CTE called annual
- Filtered the subscriptions table for only annual plans to get the start date for the upgrade
- Joined the two CTEs on the customer_id so only customers who had the pro annual plan were included
- Found the average of the annual start_date - the trial start_date and rounded to the whole number

Insights:
- On average, it took customers 105 to upgrade to the pro annual plan from their join date

---

#### 10. Can you further breakdown this average value into 30 day periods (i.e. 0-30 days, 31-60 days etc)

    WITH join_date AS (
      SELECT *
      FROM foodie_fi.subscriptions
      WHERE plan_id = 0)
    
    , annual AS (
      SELECT *
      FROM foodie_fi.subscriptions
      WHERE plan_id = 3)
    
    
    , bucket AS (
    SELECT WIDTH_BUCKET((a.start_date - j.start_date), 1, 360, 12) AS buckets,
    	ROUND(AVG(a.start_date - j.start_date), 0) AS days
    FROM join_date as j
    JOIN annual AS a
    ON j.customer_id = a.customer_id
    GROUP BY buckets
    ORDER BY buckets)
    
    SELECT CONCAT((buckets - 1) * 30 + 1, ' - ', buckets * 30) AS range_of_days,
    	days AS avg_time_to_upgrade
    FROM bucket;

| range_of_days | avg_time_to_upgrade |
| ------------- | ------------------- |
| 1 - 30        | 10                  |
| 31 - 60       | 42                  |
| 61 - 90       | 71                  |
| 91 - 120      | 101                 |
| 121 - 150     | 133                 |
| 151 - 180     | 162                 |
| 181 - 210     | 191                 |
| 211 - 240     | 224                 |
| 241 - 270     | 257                 |
| 271 - 300     | 285                 |
| 301 - 330     | 327                 |
| 331 - 360     | 346                 |

Steps:
- Used the CTEs from the previous question to find the join date and the annual upgrade date
- Created another CTE called buckets
- Used WIDTH_BUCKET to create bins. I started the sequence at 1 and ended at 360, and split that into 12 bins, which created 30 day ranges numbered 1 - 12
- Grouped by buckets
- Used the bucket CTE to make the bins more readable
- Used CONCAT to piece together a few values, starting with the bucket number - 1 multiplied by 30 then + 1. For example, the bin number 2 - 1 = 1. 1 * 30 = 30. 30 + 1 = 31. This gives the range starting number.
- The second value in the CONCAT statement is ' - ' to indicate the range
- Lastly, I added the end range number by taking the bucket * 30. For example, bin number 2 * 30 = 60. So bin number two would end up looking like '31 - 60'

Insights:
- This table just shows that if the number of days to upgrade is between a certain range of days, this is the average of how many days it took to upgrade

#### 11. How many customers downgraded from a pro monthly to a basic monthly plan in 2020?

    WITH pro_monthly AS (
      SELECT *
      FROM foodie_fi.subscriptions
      WHERE plan_id = 2 AND EXTRACT(year FROM start_date) = '2020')
    
    , basic_monthly AS (
      SELECT *
      FROM foodie_fi.subscriptions
      WHERE plan_id = 1 AND EXTRACT(year FROM start_date) = '2020')
      
    SELECT COUNT(p.customer_id) AS num_downgraded
    FROM pro_monthly AS p
    JOIN basic_monthly AS b
    ON p.customer_id = b.customer_id
    WHERE b.start_date > p.start_date;

| num_downgraded |
| -------------- |
| 0              |

Steps:
- Used the same method as the previous questions by creating CTEs to find the start dates for the two plans
- Filtered for only dates in 2020
- Joined the two CTEs
- Counted the customer_ids
- Filtered for dates where the basic monthly start_date was more recent than the pro monthly start_date, indicating a downgrade

Insights:
- No customers downgraded from the pro monthly plan to the basic monthly plan
- The pro monthly plan makes customers want to stay where they are

### 💵 C. Challenge Payment Question

The Foodie-Fi team wants you to create a new payments table for the year 2020 that includes amounts paid by each customer in the subscriptions table with the following requirements:

- monthly payments always occur on the same day of month as the original start_date of any monthly paid plan
- upgrades from basic to monthly or pro plans are reduced by the current paid amount in that month and start immediately
- upgrades from pro monthly to pro annual are paid at the end of the current billing period and also starts at the end of the month period
- once a customer churns they will no longer make payments

**Payments Table:**

        WITH lead AS (
        	SELECT *,
        		LEAD(start_date) OVER(
              	PARTITION BY customer_id

        	ORDER BY customer_id)
        
        , ending AS (
          SELECT customer_id,

          		WHEN EXTRACT(day FROM start_date) = EXTRACT(day FROM end_date)
          		THEN end_date - INTERVAL '1 day'
          		ELSE end_date END AS end_date
          FROM lead
          ORDER BY customer_id)
     
      SELECT e.customer_id,
        	e.plan_id,
            p.plan_name,
            GENERATE_SERIES(e.start_date, e.end_date, INTERVAL '1 month') AS payment_date,
            p.price,
            RANK() OVER(
              PARTITION BY e.customer_id
              ORDER BY GENERATE_SERIES(e.start_date, e.end_date, INTERVAL '1 month')) AS payment_order
        FROM ending AS e
        JOIN foodie_fi.plans AS p
        ON e.plan_id = p.plan_id
        WHERE e.plan_id <> 4
        ORDER BY e.customer_id

Steps:
- CTE #1
    - Took the subscriptions table and added a LEAD column where the start_date is moved up one place
    - Partitioned by the customer_id
    - Ordered by the customer_id and the start_date
    - This shows the end date of the current subscription because it is the start date of the next plan
    - Filtered out trial plans because they are free and don't require payments
- CTE #2
    - Selected the appropriate columns from the previous CTE
    - Created a CASE statement with a few arguments. If the end_date of the plan was *null*, that means that there is no end date and this is the plan the customer ended the year with. In this case, the date was set to 2020-12-31. Next, I noticed that if the day of the month in the start and end date were the same, the series I create later will continue on with both plans instead of stopping one and starting the next. To fix this I said that if the day in both dates match, then subtract 1 day from the end date.
- Final Query
     - Joined the previous CTE to the plans table
     - Selected the appropriate columns
     - Used GENERATE_SERIES to show each month between the start_date and end_date of a particular plan
     - Used RANK to show the payment numbers
     - Partitioned by the customer_id
     - Ordered by the dates in the series
     - Limited the results to just 50 records. The table above is just a sample of the full table with all of the customers included

Insights:
- This table is a great resource for tracking each individual payment made to Foodie Fi
- There are a lot of different metrics that can be run from this table, such as
    - Total profit for the year
    - Total profit for a particular month
    - Total profit for an individual plan
    - Example: Total profit made from the pro monthly plan in October

### 🔥 D. Outside the Box Questions
#### 1. How would you calculate the rate of growth for Foodie-Fi?

    WITH lead AS (
    	SELECT *,
    		LEAD(start_date) OVER(
          	PARTITION BY customer_id
          	ORDER BY customer_id, start_date) AS end_date

      		THEN '2020-12-31'
      		WHEN EXTRACT(day FROM start_date) = EXTRACT(day FROM end_date)
          	THEN end_date - INTERVAL '1 day'
      		ELSE end_date END AS end_date
      FROM lead
      ORDER BY customer_id)
    
    , payments AS (
      SELECT e.customer_id,
    	e.plan_id,
        p.plan_name,
        GENERATE_SERIES(e.start_date, e.end_date, INTERVAL '1 month') AS payment_date,
        p.price,
        RANK() OVER(
          PARTITION BY e.customer_id
          ORDER BY GENERATE_SERIES(e.start_date, e.end_date, INTERVAL '1 month')) AS payment_order
      FROM ending AS e
      JOIN foodie_fi.plans AS p
      ON e.plan_id = p.plan_id
      WHERE e.plan_id <> 4
      ORDER BY e.customer_id)
    
    SELECT EXTRACT(month FROM payment_date) AS month,
    	COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id) AS customer_count
    FROM payments
    WHERE EXTRACT(month FROM payment_date) IN (1, 12)
    GROUP BY EXTRACT(month FROM payment_date);

| month | customer_count |
| ----- | -------------- |
| 1     | 201            |
| 12    | 751            |


   SELECT ROUND(((751::numeric - 201::numeric) / 201::numeric) * 100, 2) AS customer_growth_rate_percentage;

| customer_growth_rate_percentage |
| ------------------------------- |
| 273.63                          |


There are a couple of ways to calculate the rate of growth of Foodie Fi. The method above calculates the rate of growth of active customers at the beginning of 2020 compared to the end of 2020. I counted an active customer as someone who was making payments.

Steps:
- I used the Payments Table that I created above and turned the final query into a CTE
- Used that CTE to extract the month from the payments that were made
- Counted the distinct number of customers
- Filtered for only customers who made payments in month 1 or 12
- Grouped by the month to get the number of active customers in January and December
- Used the growth rate formula and the numbers I just found to get a 200.63% growth rate in active customers from the beginning of 2020 to the end of 2020
---

     SELECT EXTRACT(month FROM payment_date) AS month,
        	SUM(price) AS profit
        FROM payments
        WHERE EXTRACT(month FROM payment_date) IN (1, 12)
        GROUP BY EXTRACT(month FROM payment_date)
        ORDER BY EXTRACT(month FROM payment_date);

| month | profit   |
| ----- | -------- |
| 1     | 4342.10  |
| 12    | 47718.20 |




   SELECT ROUND(((47718.20::numeric - 4342.10::numeric) / 4342.10::numeric) * 100, 2) AS customer_growth_rate_percentage;

| profit_growth_rate_percentage |
| ----------------------------- |
| 998.97                        |

Another way to calulate the growth rate of Foodie Fi is to calculate the growth rate in profit from the beginning of 2020 to the end of 2020

Steps:
- Used the Payments Table and the same method as before, but instead of counting customers, I found the sum of the prices to find the total profit
- Again, used the growth rate formula to find a 998.97% increase in profit from the beginning of 2020 to the end of 2020

#### 2. What key metrics would you recommend Foodie-Fi management to track over time to assess performance of their overall business?

- Number of new members per month
- Number of customers who cancel their subscription each week or month
    - Those who churn right after the free trial
    - Those who churn after paying for a plan
- Amount of times customers upgrade to each of the different plans 
- Total active members per month

---

#### 3. What are some key customer journeys or experiences that you would analyse further to improve customer retention?

- Customers who have upgraded to a paid plan at some point but then cancel their subscription
- Any customers who might have downgraded their plan
- Customers who have a paid plan and then decide to upgrade to a higher plan

---

#### 4. If the Foodie-Fi team were to create an exit survey shown to customers who wish to cancel their subscription, what questions would you include in the survey?

- How would you rate the content available on Foodie Fi on a scale of 1 - 5 (1 being the worst and 5 being the best)
- How would you rate the value of (their specific subscription plan) on a scale of 1 - 5 (1 being the worst and 5 being the best)
- Was there any content you felt should have been included on Foodie Fi but was not available?
- How would you rate the Foodie Fi app on a scale of 1 - 5 (1 being the worst and 5 being the best)
- Are there any changes you would make to the Foodie Fi app?

---

#### 5. What business levers could the Foodie-Fi team use to reduce the customer churn rate? How would you validate the effectiveness of your ideas?

- Send out a weekly e-mail highlighting any new or significant content
    - This could be validated through A/B testing where retention numbers are compared between customers who receive the e-mail and those who do not
- Occasional promotions for discounted upgrade rates (such as $5 off per month for a year)
    - I feel like this could be used to target the customers who sign up for the free trial and then immediately cancel. A promotion might entice them into upgrading their plan instead of cancelling
    - This can be validated by seeing if there is an increase in plan upgrades while the promotion is running
    - This can also be checked afer the promotional period has ended to see if more customers cancel their subscription after the payment goes back up
- Offering discounts on plans to customers who are wanting to cancel their subscriptions
    - This can be validated by comparing the churn rate over time against the churn rate after a discount is offered

## 🚀 Final Thoughts

I really liked how this case study made me think in a completely different way as compared to the last one. The Pizza Runner case study was very SQL heavy and much more difficult as far as the code goes, but this one switched gears to focus a bit more on business intelligence. The last section of Outside the Box Questions was a great way to show how the data analysis results can be applied in a real life business situation. The analysis we did here was great to give the steakholder a snapshot of what is going on and how the business is performing, but without knowing why there were no new trial members in 2021 or why only 2% of customers have the pro annual plan, it is hard to make any suggestions on how to improve these numbers without futher investigation. The last section really helped dig into next steps, like sending out a customer survey and trying to reduce customer churn rate. After that, there is already a plan on how to track these changes to see if they are effective. Hopefully Danny starts to see a lower churn rate after these changes and even more plan upgrades.

Thank you so much for following along on another Data With Danny case study!
