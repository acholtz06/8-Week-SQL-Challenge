### ü¶ê B. Product Funnel Analysis

#### Using a single SQL query - create a new output table which has the following details:  
**- How many times was each product viewed?**  
**- How many times was each product added to cart?**   
**- How many times was each product added to a cart but not purchased (abandoned)?**  
**- How many times was each product purchased?**

**- cart_adds: count of product cart add events for each visit**  
**- purchase: 1/0 flag if a purchase event exists for each visit**

**- impression: count of ad impressions for each visit**  
**- click: count of ad clicks for each visit**
