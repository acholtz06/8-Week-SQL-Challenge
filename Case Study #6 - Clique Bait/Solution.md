### ü¶ê B. Product Funnel Analysis

#### Using a single SQL query - create a new output table which has the following details:  
**- How many times was each product viewed?**  
**- How many times was each product added to cart?**   
**- How many times was each product added to a cart but not purchased (abandoned)?**  
**- How many times was each product purchased?**

### ü¶ë C. Campaigns Analysis

#### Generate a table that has 1 single row for every unique visit_id record and has the following columns:

**- user_id**  
**- visit_id**  
**- visit_start_time: the earliest event_time for each visit**  
**- page_views: count of page views for each visit**  
**- cart_adds: count of product cart add events for each visit**  
**- purchase: 1/0 flag if a purchase event exists for each visit**  
**- campaign_name: map the visit to a campaign if the visit_start_time falls between the start_date and end_date**  
**- impression: count of ad impressions for each visit**  
**- click: count of ad clicks for each visit**  
**- (Optional column) cart_products: a comma separated text value with products added to the cart sorted by the order they were added to the cart (hint: use the sequence_number)**
